\begin{itemize}
\item  A model of uncertainty:
\begin{itemize}
\item reconstruction *(Pujades)
\item depth synthesis
\item depth resynthesis
\item plane estimation
\item compact and efficuient representation
\end{itemize}


\item Iterative multi-view depth synthesis
\begin{itemize}
\item multi-view constraints on depth synthesis (how ?)
\item resynthesis when spixels error is too high in qualeval
\item using alternate sources of depth (objects such as cars, streetview / earth fusion)
\item see also previous notes on depth synthesis
\end{itemize}

\item A new rendering algorithm
\begin{itemize}
\item combines advantages of forward and backward IBR (hierarchical, multi-camera)
\item advantages: many cameras, still very efficient
\item  Optional: good stereo rendering for depth synthesized regions (volumetric rendering)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
