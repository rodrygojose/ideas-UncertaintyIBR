We will compare to \cite{chaurasia13,ODD15}; we expect to see significant improvement due to
the use of more cameras, overcoming the limitation of the number of cameras used and the 
``fronto-parallel'' superpixel issue. 

We also expect to see significantly better quality for
vegetation (no popping or ghosting). We will also need to compare to \cite{dibr}, although we
doubt the quality will be much better. \TODO{maybe ask them for a non-interpolation path}
